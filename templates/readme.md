# Go PDF Service Summary

## Overview

This Go service generates PDFs based on input data, optionally merging them with call sheets. It's built using the standard `net/http` package and the `gorilla/mux` router, which are roughly analogous to Node.js's `http` module and the Express framework, respectively.

## Key Components

### 1. Main Function

```go
func main() {
    r := mux.NewRouter()
    r.HandleFunc("/", homeHandler).Methods("GET")
    r.HandleFunc("/generate-pdf", generatePDFHandler).Methods("POST")
    // ...
}
```

This is similar to setting up routes in Express:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.get('/', homeHandler);
app.post('/generate-pdf', generatePDFHandler);
```

### 2. HTTP Handlers

In Go, HTTP handlers are functions with the signature:

```go
func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)
```

This is similar to Express middleware/route handlers:

```javascript
function(req, res, next) {}
```

The `http.ResponseWriter` is analogous to the `res` object in Express, while `*http.Request` is similar to the `req` object.

### 3. Request Parsing

Go:
```go
var req PDFRequest
err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&req)
```

Express with body-parser:
```javascript
app.use(express.json());
// In route handler:
const req = req.body;
```

### 4. Response Writing

Go:
```go
w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/pdf")
w.Write(pdf)
```

Express:
```javascript
res.contentType('application/pdf');
res.send(pdf);
```

## Key Differences

1. **Type System**: Go is statically typed, while JavaScript is dynamically typed. This means you need to define structures like `PDFRequest` in Go, whereas in JavaScript you can work with objects directly.

2. **Error Handling**: Go uses explicit error checking (`if err != nil`), while JavaScript typically uses try/catch blocks or Promise chains.

3. **Concurrency**: Go has built-in concurrency primitives (goroutines and channels), which are more powerful than JavaScript's asynchronous model.

4. **Memory Management**: Go has automatic garbage collection, but also allows more control over memory layout. Node.js relies entirely on V8's garbage collector.

## Tips for Node.js Developers

1. In Go, you don't need to `await` asynchronous operations. Instead, you handle errors explicitly after each operation that can fail.

2. Go's `http.Handler` interface (which functions with the signature `func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request)` satisfy) is similar to Express middleware, but with a different approach to chaining.

3. Unlike Express where you often use third-party middleware for parsing request bodies, Go's standard library provides this functionality out of the box.

4. Go's `gorilla/mux` router is more similar to Express routing than the standard `net/http` ServeMux.

Remember, while there are similarities, Go and Node.js have different philosophies and strengths. Go excels in scenarios requiring high concurrency and performance, while Node.js shines in rapid development and has a vast ecosystem of packages.
